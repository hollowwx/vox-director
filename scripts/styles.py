Per-era style bible for vox-director (validated on Atlas Cloud / Nano Banana 2).

Each STYLE_BASE is scene-agnostic: it fixes ONLY the visual idiom of a dynasty.
compose_keyframe_prompt() appends the beat's scene + a shared bilingual
title/seal treatment so the whole film stays coherent while the style evolves.

# Shared collage MECHANICS (same for every style) — only the visual IDIOM changes.
# The library is a palette + quality floor, NOT a fixed menu: the agent reads the topic,
# picks the 3-4 idioms that fit its era/culture/tone (or composes a custom one), runs a
# bake-off, and the human picks. Match the idiom to the TOPIC, not the language — an English
# film about Chinese history should still look Chinese (that's fine). The goal is the right
# look per topic, not a fixed default culture.
